### Amplitude Modulation

In this example, the user can observe the effect of the variation of
fundamental parameters of default amplitude modulation on the receiver.

The AM_TX.grc file to be runned at the transmitter (VM + USRP) implements the
AM transmitter.

The AM-RX.grc file to be runned at the receiver
(Raspberry PI + RTL-SDR) implements the AM receiver.
