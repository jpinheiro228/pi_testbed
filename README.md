# The Raspberry Pi SDR Testbed

This project aims to develop an SDR Testbed based on RTL-SDR dongles plugged into RaspberryPi3 hardware.
Also, we will have USRPs connected to Virtual machines to act as more powerfull transmitters.

The resources will be made available from a web interface which will give the user access to the hardware via SSH console.
With this, the user will be able to access softwares that interface with the SDR to conduct experiments using our harware.
